						<h2>Browser extension</h2>
					   <div class="text">A browser extension is a small software module for customizing a web browser.
		 					Browsers typically allow a variety of extensions, including user interface modifications, ad blocking, and cookie management.
		 <p>
		 Browser plug-ins are a separate type of module.
		 The main difference is that extensions are usually just source code, but plug-ins are always executables (i.e. object code).
		 As of 2019, plug-ins have been deprecated by most browsers, while extensions are widely used.
		 The most popular browser, Google Chrome, has thousands of extensions available but only one plug-in: the Adobe Flash Player that is disabled by default.
		 <p>
		 WebExtensions are created using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.

					<h2>Example</h2>
						<h4>uBlock Origin, Reader and Toolbox for Google Play Store™</h4>
					<div class="wrapper">
					<div class="text">You might want to help users block annoying ads, give access to travel guides when a country
					or city is mentioned on a page, or format the page to give an unforgettable reading experience.
					With access to HTML and CSS, add-ons can help users look at the Internet the way they want.

								<h2>History</h2>
								 <div class="text">Internet Explorer was the first major browser to support extensions, with the release of version 5 in 1999.
									 Firefox has supported extensions since its launch in 2004. Opera began supporting extensions in 2009,
									 and both Google Chrome and Safari did so the following year. Microsoft Edge added extension support in 2016.
				 </div>

		<section>
				<h2>Support for various browsers</h2>
				 <div class="text" id="fragments">
					 Extensions created using WebExtension are supported by all major browsers:
					 <ul>
 						<li class="fragment">Google Chrome and browsers based on the Chromium project: Opera, UCBrowser, Yandex. Browser etc</li>
 						<li class="fragment">Firefox - starting with version 45</li>
 						<li class="fragment">Microsoft edge</li>
 					</ul>

	<h2>Extension structure</h2><p>
		<div class="wrapper1">
	<div class="text">The WebExtensions extension is a zip archive with an almost arbitrary internal structure of nested directories and files.
		One of the few requirements in terms of structure is the presence of manifest.json, a JSON file that establishes the protocol
		of interaction between the browser, extension and browser user.
</div>
<div><img src="img/json.png" alt="Json"></div>
		</div></section>

		<section id="fragments">
				<h2>What the manifest might contain</h2>
				 <div class="text">
					 <ul>
						<li class="fragment">General information about the extension: name, version, short and full description.</li>
						<li class="fragment">The list of permissions that the extension needs for its work and which the browser user either issues or rejects
							when installing the extension.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Details of interaction with the browser: the so-called background pages and background JavaScript scripts that
							will be loaded into the browser at startup; content scripts - JavaScript scripts that will be loaded onto web pages
							that meet the specified conditions; Browser user interface elements - settings pages, icons in the toolbar, address bar, etc.</li>
					</ul>

		<h2>Unwanted behavior</h2>
		<p>
		 <div class="text">Browser extensions typically have access to sensitive data, such as browsing history,
			 and have the ability to alter some browser settings, add user interface items, or replace website content.
			 As a result, there have been instances of malware, so users need to be cautious about what extensions they install.
<p>
	There have also been cases of applications installing browser extensions without the user's knowledge, while making it hard for the user
	to uninstall the unwanted extension.
	<p>
		Extensions that use WebExtension APIs are provided with several user
			interface options so that their functionality can be made available to the user.
<p>
 A summary of those options is provided below, with a more detailed introduction to each user interface option in this section.

	<div class="text">JavaScript APIs for WebExtensions can be used inside the extension's background scripts and in any other documents
		bundled with the extension, including browser action or page action popups, sidebars, options pages, or new tab pages.
		A few of these APIs can also be accessed by an extension's content scripts.
